## CleverTap Android SDK CHANGE LOG

### Version 5.2.1 (October 12, 2023)

#### New Features

- Adds Custom Proxy Domain functionality for Push Impressions and Events raised from CleverTap SDK. Please refer to [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md#integrate-custom-proxy-domain) file to read more on how to
  configure custom proxy domains.
- Adds new API,
  * `setLocale(String locale)`
      - This API allows you to set a custom locale for the required clevertap instance. Different instances can have different locales
- Adds support for Integration Debugger

### Version 5.2.0 (August 10, 2023)

#### New Features

* Adds support for encryption of PII data wiz. Email, Identity, Name and Phone. 
  Please refer to [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md#encryption-of-pii-data) file to read more on how to
  enable/disable encryption.
* Adds support for custom KV pairs common to all inbox messages in AppInbox.

#### Bug Fixes

  current values of the user properties instead of appending it.
* Fixes [#393](https://github.com/CleverTap/clevertap-android-sdk/issues/393) - push permission flow 
  crash when context in CoreMetadata is null.

### Version 5.1.0 (June 28, 2023)

> ⚠️ **NOTE**

```
Please remove the integrated Rendermax SDK before you upgrade to Android SDK v5.1.0
```

#### New Features

* Adds new APIs,
    * `getNotificationBitmapWithTimeout(
      Context context, Bundle bundle, String bitmapSrcUrl,
      boolean fallbackToAppIcon, long timeoutInMillis)`
        - This API allows you to retrieve a notification bitmap from the specified `bitmapSrcUrl`
          with a specified timeout. In case the bitmap retrieval fails, you can choose to fallback
          to the app icon by setting the `fallbackToAppIcon` parameter. This API provides more
          control over the bitmap retrieval process for custom rendering.
    * `getNotificationBitmapWithTimeoutAndSize(
      Context context, Bundle bundle, String bitmapSrcUrl,
      boolean fallbackToAppIcon, long timeoutInMillis, int sizeInBytes)`
        - This API extends the functionality of the previous one by additionally allowing you to
          specify the desired size in bytes for the retrieved bitmap. This is useful when you need
          to limit the size of the bitmap to optimize memory usage.
          By utilizing these new APIs, you can enhance the push delivery experience for custom
          rendering and ensure efficient handling of notification bitmaps in your Android app.
* Adds support for developer defined default notification channel. Please refer to
  the [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md#push-notifications) file to read more on how to setup default
  channel in your app.Also please note that this is only supported for clevertap core notifications.
  Support for push templates will be released soon.
* RenderMax Push SDK functionality is now supported directly within the CleverTap Core SDK.
* Adds interface for `Leanplum` APIs. This interface wraps `CleverTapAPI` methods inside `Leanplum`
  APIs to ensure a smoother migration experience.

#### API Changes

* Adds `SCCampaignOptOut` Event to Restricted Events Name List for **internal use**.
* Adds custom sdk versions to `af` field for **internal use**.

#### Breaking API Changes

* **CTFlushPushImpressionsWork breaks custom WorkerFactory implementation of an App**:
    * If you are using custom `WorkFactory` implementation of `WorkManager` then make sure that you
      correctly handle workers defined by CleverTap SDK and other third party dependencies.
    * You must return `null` from `createWorker()` for any unknown workerClassName. Please check
      implementation provided in the
      bolg [here](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/customizing-workmanager-fundamentals-fdaa17c46dd2)

* **Behavioral change of `createNotification` methods**:
    * The following APIs now run on the caller's thread. Make sure to call it
      in `onMessageReceive()` of messaging service:
        - `CTFcmMessageHandler().createNotification(getApplicationContext(), message)`
        - `CleverTapAPI.createNotification(getApplicationContext(), extras)`
        - `CTXiaomiMessageHandler().createNotification(getApplicationContext(), message)`
        - `CTHmsMessageHandler().createNotification(getApplicationContext(), message)` - **This API
          should always be called on a background thread.**

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixes [#428](https://github.com/CleverTap/clevertap-android-sdk/issues/428) - Race-condition when
  detecting if an in-app message should show.
* Fixes Push primer alert dialog freeze behavior, which became unresponsive when clicked outside the
  window.

### Version 5.0.0 (May 5, 2023)

#### New Features

* Adds support for Remote Config Variables. Please refer to the [Variables.md](Variables.md) file to
  read more on how to integrate this to your app.
* Adds new APIs, `markReadInboxMessagesForIDs(ArrayList<String> messageIDs)`
  and `deleteInboxMessagesForIDs(ArrayList<String> messageIDs)` to mark read and delete an array of
  Inbox Messages.

#### API Changes

* **Deprecated:** The following methods and classes related to Product Config and Feature Flags have
  been marked as deprecated in this release, instead use new remote config variables feature. These
  methods and classes will be removed in the future versions with prior notice.
    * Product config
        - `productConfig()`
        - `productConfig().setDefaults()`
        - `productConfig().fetch()`
        - `productConfig().fetch(intervalInSeconds)`
        - `productConfig().activate()`
        - `productConfig().fetchAndActivate()`
        - `setCTProductConfigListener()`
        - `onInit()`
        - `onFetched()`
        - `onActivated()`
        - `productConfig().setMinimumFetchIntervalInSeconds(seconds)`
        - `productConfig().getBoolean(key)`
        - `productConfig().getDouble(key)`
        - `productConfig().getLong(key)`
        - `productConfig().getString(key)`
        - `productConfig().reset()`
        - `productConfig().getLastFetchTimeStampInMillis()`

        - `setCTFeatureFlagsListener()`
        - `featureFlagsUpdated()`
        - `featureFlag().get(key,defaultVal)`

#### Breaking API Changes
* **Signature change of `onInboxItemClicked` callback**:
  It is changed from `onInboxItemClicked(CTInboxMessage message)` to `onInboxItemClicked(CTInboxMessage message, int contentPageIndex, int buttonIndex)`. The `contentPageIndex` corresponds to the page index of the content, which ranges from 0 to the total number of pages for carousel templates. For non-carousel templates, the value is always 0, as they only have one page of content. The `buttonIndex` represents the index of the App Inbox button clicked (0, 1, or 2). A value of -1 indicates the App Inbox item is clicked.

* **Behavioral change of `onInboxItemClicked` callback**:
  - Previously, the callback was raised when the App Inbox Item is clicked.
  - Now, it is also raised when the App Inbox button and Item is clicked.

* Used `ConcurrentHashMap` instead of `HashMap` for storing `CleverTapAPI` instances to prevent ConcurrentModificationException when trying to access the instances concurrently.
* Made calls to `findCTPushProvider()` and `findCustomEnabledPushTypes()` async to prevent ANR when called on main thread.
* Renames `setPushPermissionNotificationResponseListener(PushPermissionResponseListener)` to `registerPushPermissionNotificationResponseListener(PushPermissionResponseListener)` . Each `PushPermissionResponseListener` instance passed in this method is now maintained in a list of the `PushPermissionResponseListener` type and the Push Primer result is notified to all the elements of this list.
* Adds `unregisterPushPermissionNotificationResponseListener(PushPermissionResponseListener)` method in `CleverTapAPI` class to unregister the  `PushPermissionResponseListener` instance to stop observing the  Push Primer result.
* Use v4.7.2, this version contains a bug which causes a crash (`ClassCastException`) in header/footer InApp templates.


### Version 4.7.0 (November 1, 2022)

#### Changes
* Renames the `itemIndex` parameter of the `onInboxItemClicked` callback with the `contentPageIndex`. It's not a breaking change.
* **[Parity with CleverTap iOS SDK]**:
  The `onInboxItemClicked` callback now provides a different value for contentPageIndex(ex-`itemIndex`) compared to before. Previously, it used to indicate the position of the clicked item within the list container of the App Inbox. However, now it indicates the page index of the content, which ranges from 0 to the total number of pages for carousel templates.

  It is changed from  `onInboxItemClicked(CTInboxMessage message)` to `onInboxItemClicked(CTInboxMessage message, int itemIndex, int buttonIndex)`. The `itemIndex` corresponds the index of the item clicked in the list whereas the `buttonIndex` for the App Inbox button clicked (0, 1, or 2). A value of -1 indicates the App Inbox item is clicked.

* **Behavioral change of `onInboxItemClicked` callback**:
  - Previously, the callback was raised when the App Inbox Item is clicked.
  - Now, it is also raised when the App Inbox button and Item is clicked.
